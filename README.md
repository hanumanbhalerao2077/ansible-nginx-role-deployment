### 4️⃣ Scroll down → Commit new file
- Add a commit message like: `Add README with project description and usage`
- Choose **Commit directly to main**  
- Click **Commit new file**

---

After this, your README.md will appear in the repo immediately, and you don’t need to use Git locally for it. ✅

If you want, I can **also make it prettier with badges and project link** so it looks professional for recruiters.  

Do you want me to do that?
